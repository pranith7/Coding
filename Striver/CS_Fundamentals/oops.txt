OOPS stands for "Object-Oriented Programming System" or "Object-Oriented Programming Structure." 
It is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data 
and code that operates on that data.

In OOP, objects are created from "classes," which are templates or blueprints for creating 
objects. Each object is an instance of a class and has its own set of attributes (data) and 
behaviors (methods or functions).

OOP is designed to allow developers to create and work with objects that model real-world entities,
making it easier to design, test, and maintain complex software systems. Some of the key features 
of OOP include encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

Encapsulation refers to the idea of bundling data and methods that operate on that data within 
a single unit, or object. This allows developers to hide the implementation details of a class 
from other parts of the code, making it easier to change the implementation without affecting 
the rest of the code.

Inheritance allows a subclass to inherit the attributes and methods of a superclass, making it 
easier to create and maintain a hierarchy of classes.

Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated the same way, even if their 
internal implementation is different. This is achieved through the use of interfaces and abstract classes.

Abstraction refers to the process of exposing only the necessary information about an object 
to the outside world, hiding the implementation details.
